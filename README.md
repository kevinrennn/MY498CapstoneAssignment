# MY498 Capstone Assignment
Topic: *A Machine Learning Approach To Identify Linguistic Markers Of Depression And The Obstacles To Seeking Help Among Adolescents And Young Adults*

This repository contains my MY498 Capstone Assignment for the MSc Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics.

I take a machine learning approach to classify posts into a depression-indicative and control class including na√Øve bayes, logistic regression, random forests, bagging, extreme gradient boosting, recurrent neural networks, gated recurrent units, (bidirectional) long short-term memory and transformers. In addition, I examine which linguistic markers are indicative of depression by applying a keyness analysis using Chi-squared statistics.

In the second part of this study I analyse which factors contribute most significantly to professsional help-seeking inhibiting behaviour among adolescents and young adults by conducting a keyness analysis and word embedding analysis. In this process a depression help-seeking lexicon was also produced for further research use.
